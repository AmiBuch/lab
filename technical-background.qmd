### Git and GitHub

### Python Data Science Stack

1. We recommend students to study the [Python for Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.
2. We recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as [100 Numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100). Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.
