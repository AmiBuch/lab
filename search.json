It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python"
