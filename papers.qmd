title: "Writing Papers"

#### Paper structure and Abstract
I gave a talk ([recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoCoplWgvp4), [slides here](https://github.com/nipunbatra/CS-Research-Methods-Bootcamp/blob/master/RM101.pdf)) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available [here](https://github.com/nipunbatra/CS-Research-Methods-Bootcamp).

#### Tables
We follow this excellent [small guide to making nice tables](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/markusp/teaching/guides/guide-tables.pdf) by Markus PÃ¼schel.

#### Comments in LaTeX
We typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use `\nb` for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write `\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence}` and then I can search for all instances of `\nb` to find all of my comments.

```tex
\newcommand{\nb}[1]{{\color{red}\small \iftoggle{hide}{}{\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}
```
