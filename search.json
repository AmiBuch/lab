    "text": "Hard work: We are often working on cutting-edge research. This means that there is no clear path to success. We will have to try different things, and we will fail often. This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences."
