It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python"

Posters are a great way to present your work in a visual format, and to have one-on-one conversations with people who are interested in your work.\nOne common mistake people make while making posters is to try to cram in too much information. Remember that the poster is to supplement you and not to replace you.\nPlease see below for two posters that we have made in the past."

    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences."
