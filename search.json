    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences."

    "text": "ES 654: My Foray into Machine Learning\nMy journey into Machine Learning began with securing an internship at BEES Lab, IISc Bangalore, after my sophomore year. This experience plunged me into the thrilling world of Machine Learning. As a newcomer, I found the field daunting, filled with advanced concepts and rapidly evolving technologies. It was challenging to grasp the essence of Machine Learning and delve deeper. I pondered on differentiating myself from being just another coder proficient in CNN architectures using PyTorch to understanding fundamental concepts like the impact of a single LayerNorm block on model performance, the role of regularization in inducing generality, and the importance of visualizing the workings of the so-called “black box” of a neural network. The learning curve seemed colossal. Fortuitously, it was during this time that I was introduced to the course ES 654, an introduction to Machine Learning, taught by Prof. Nipun.\nFrom the very first class, where Prof. Nipun introduced us to the broad scope of AI, I knew this course would be a turning point in my career. His teaching approach made me realize the importance of understanding classical Machine Learning’s intuition, often overshadowed by implicit modeling in Neural Modelling Strategies. The course took us from implementing Decision Trees and various classical Machine Learning algorithms in pure Python to building neural networks from scratch. It illuminated the intuition behind optimization strategies and autograd workings. The structured learning helped solidify my foundation in Machine Learning. Particularly impactful were the on-paper tests, where we derived vectorized solutions to various problems, significantly boosting my confidence and understanding."

The best thing about Prof. Nipun was the way he streamlined the learning experience and crafted it individually for every single student. My initial task involved bug fixes in Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming library on Pytorch. This was my first foray into open-source ML contributions, and Prof. Nipun’s guidance was invaluable. I remember him hand-holding me in this task and giving me code suggestions before I made the commits. The best part was him celebrating with me on the small victory of the first PR getting merged! This marked the beginning of my deep dive into Bayesian Machine Learning, focusing on Gaussian Processes and Neural Kernel Networks, which became my primary areas of interest at SL."

The highlight of my time at SL were the weekly meetings with Prof. Nipun. His guidance extended beyond theoretical solutions to the nitty-gritty of implementation. His mentorship played a crucial role in my development, not just academically but also in how I approach problems in my current corporate research role at Skan. Our collaborative work, including contributions from fellow students Aadesh Desai and Zeel Patel, was recognized at the NeurIPS workshop on Gaussian Processes in 2023."

This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

Currently, I am a Senior Consultant at eClerx, where I specialise in Data Analytics and Engineering for a global investment bank.\nI had the privilege to work with Prof. Nipun as one of his first M.Tech students. This post narrates my enriching experience under his mentorship.\n Picture 1: (Dec 2022) returned to college for a late convocation.\n\n\nResearch Endeavours and Milestones\nThe M.Tech program consisted of 50% coursework and 50% research. My work with Prof. Nipun started in January 2019, broadly focusing on air quality estimation.\n• Experimention with portable air quality sensors (Jan 2019 - Apr 2019)\nI measured PM2.5 exposure among construction workers and calibrated five sensors to plot and analyse the data.\n Picture 2: (Feb 2019) calibrating Atmos air quality sensors at my workspace\n\n\nDeveloping a Live Air quality dashboard (May 2019 - Jul 2019)\nI deployed 5 air quality sensors across the campus and created a live dashboard using JavaScript, Python (Flask), and Leaflet.js. This project was crucial in identifying high pollution activities and their timings.\n\nPicture 3: (May 2019) Installing an air quality sensor at IIT Gn\n\nPicture 4: (Jun 2019) Live air quality measurements across 5 locations on campus\nI got introduced to interdisciplinary research - the goal was to calculate the exposure of PM2.5 in our college bus route. I worked in Tinkerer’s lab with a mechanical engineer to design a 3D printed mount using MDF, which was mounted in the moving bus:\n\n• Estimating ground air quality using satellite data (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019)\nAir quality sensors were expensive and provided less spatial coverage, we used satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological fields to estimate surface-level PM2.5 using a regression model.\nProf. Nipun encouraged me to write a short 1-page paper and submit it to CoDS-COMAD. I got my first short paper published [link] at ISB Hyderabad in January 2020. Fun fact: the presentation coincided with my birthday :)\n\nPicture 5: (Jan 2020) Presenting at CoDS-COMAD conference in ISB Hyderabad\n• Data Curation and Machine Learning (Jan 2020 - Jul 2020)\nGathered PM, AOD, and meteorological data for India through various sources and collated them in time and space. Used Ridge regression, random forest, time-series cross-validation for our analysis like seasonal variation in pollution. This study helped us in identifying the challenges for data curation and collocation for India.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the research, here are some links - [video][slides][pdf]\n\n\nBeyond Research\nThe learnings from Prof. Nipun that still resonate with me:\n\nDiscipline &gt; motivation\nPrioritise your health\nValuing the impact of work over accolades and recognition\n\nDuring my last semester in college, there was an abrupt change in our work due to lockdown and COVID. Prof. Nipun was supportive and understanding, guided me with my thesis and empathised during hard situations at home.\nProf. Nipun didn’t hand me solutions that cultivated a mindset of problem solving. This mindset helped me deal with different situations in my professional life too. I’d be forever grateful that I could have him as my thesis supervisor in college, and a lifelong mentor in life.\n\nPicture 6: A view from the terrace of my workspace, overlooking the Sabarmati river, was a constant reminder of how beautiful the campus is, and how privileged I was to be working there."

    "text": "NILMTK: A summer endeavor\nDuring the summer, I had the opportunity to work on NILMTK, where my primary objective was to incorporate the latest state-of-the-art disaggregation algorithms into the toolkit. Over the next two months, my fellow summer interns and I successfully engineered a packaged solution. Soon, we also took the decision to publish a paper for the BuildSys conference regarding the same. It was my first experience with technical writing, I faced many challenges with the same. My initial draft was nowhere close to where it should be, it had incomplete explanations and other writing nuances. Prof. Nipun gave me pinpointed feedback and helped me get better at writing papers.\nAmidst the journey, life threw a curveball in the form of a severe stomach infection just two weeks prior to the paper submission deadline. Prof. Nipun not only empathized with my situation but also extended the gesture of taking me to a hospital in Ahmedabad. It led to realization that I had a mentor willing to go to great lengths to support me.\nOur efforts came to fruition, as the paper was accepted in the conference. The elation I felt upon acceptance was profound. This entire experience improved my technical abilities significantly."

    "text": "Transformation as a Data Scientist\nDuring my final year at IIT Gandhinagar, I approached Prof. Nipun seeking guidance on transitioning to a full-time career in data science. Despite possessing solid knowledge of machine learning, my challenge was securing interview opportunities rather than a skill deficiency. With Prof. Nipun’s support, I gained access to interviews at esteemed organizations like Bidgely, Wadhwani AI, and Reliance Jio.\nI landed my first job as a data scientist at Reliance Jio, thanks to Prof. Nipun. He’s willing to leverage both his academic and professional networks, going above and beyond to ensure our success."

    "text": "Edge Methodologies in NILM: A Swift Research Venture\nAmidst the abrupt conclusion of my time at IIT Gandhinagar due to the pandemic, I embarked on a remarkable research journey during my final semester. Prof. Nipun presented a unique opportunity – explore edge computing methodologies in the context of NILM, and submit our findings to Buildsys.\nWith the deadline just six weeks away, time was of essence. Within two days, we outlined methodologies and devised an action plan. Collaborating with fellow ML enthusiasts from IITGN, we worked collectively on the submission . My honed technical skills since the past two years facilitated rapid implementation of chosen methodologies. Similarly, my technical writing skills also have improved with the previous experiences. Soon, we were able to submit an excellent initial draft. Two months later, we got the news that our submission got accepted. I felt a sense of accomplishment as we delivered quality work within the tight six-week time frame."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI’ll end my note with an ML analogy Before joining the sustainability lab, my passion resembled an oscillating loss function—scattered and lacking direction. However, working with the lab acted as a compass, defining a clear long-term objective akin to choosing a performance metric to optimize for. Over the course of two years, I applied gradient descent in my efforts, taking numerous small steps toward the goal. The presence of an exceptional mentor, serving as an optimizer, ensured I stayed on the right path throughout the journey.\nThe sustainability lab has been instrumental in shaping who I am today. I’m forever thankful for the valuable experiences and insights gained under the guidance of Prof. Nipun."

I’m linking two such resources here: - YouTube video by Kevin Stratvert - Github skills\n\n\nPython Data Science Stack\n\nWe recommend students to study the Python for Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python\nRealPython has a nice tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We recommend students to go through the tutorial. They also have a corresponding video page.\n\n\nLaTeX\nWe typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial.\n\n\nCreating a Website and Blog\nWe highly recommend students create a simple website and a blog. We have been happily using Quarto for our website and blog. You may see in action in Nipun’s website and corresponding GitHub repo here; and Nipun’s blog and corresponding Github repo here.\nBoth of these are built via Github actions. Feel free to reuse these for creating your own website and blog. We will be happy to help you get started."
