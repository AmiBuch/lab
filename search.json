It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python\n\n\nLaTeX\nWe typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial."

    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences."

This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

    "text": "ES 654: My Foray into Machine Learning\nMy journey into Machine Learning began with securing an internship at BEES Lab, IISc Bangalore, after my sophomore year. This experience plunged me into the thrilling world of Machine Learning. As a newcomer, I found the field daunting, filled with advanced concepts and rapidly evolving technologies. It was challenging to grasp the essence of Machine Learning and delve deeper. I pondered on differentiating myself from being just another coder proficient in CNN architectures using PyTorch to understanding fundamental concepts like the impact of a single LayerNorm block on model performance, the role of regularization in inducing generality, and the importance of visualizing the workings of the so-called “black box” of a neural network. The learning curve seemed colossal. Fortuitously, it was during this time that I was introduced to the course ES 654, an introduction to Machine Learning, taught by Prof. Nipun.\nFrom the very first class, where Prof. Nipun introduced us to the broad scope of AI, I knew this course would be a turning point in my career. His teaching approach made me realize the importance of understanding classical Machine Learning’s intuition, often overshadowed by implicit modeling in Neural Modelling Strategies. The course took us from implementing Decision Trees and various classical Machine Learning algorithms in pure Python to building neural networks from scratch. It illuminated the intuition behind optimization strategies and autograd workings. The structured learning helped solidify my foundation in Machine Learning. Particularly impactful were the on-paper tests, where we derived vectorized solutions to various problems, significantly boosting my confidence and understanding."

The best thing about Prof. Nipun was the way he streamlined the learning experience and crafted it individually for every single student. My initial task involved bug fixes in Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming library on Pytorch. This was my first foray into open-source ML contributions, and Prof. Nipun’s guidance was invaluable. I remember him hand-holding me in this task and giving me code suggestions before I made the commits. The best part was him celebrating with me on the small victory of the first PR getting merged! This marked the beginning of my deep dive into Bayesian Machine Learning, focusing on Gaussian Processes and Neural Kernel Networks, which became my primary areas of interest at SL."

The highlight of my time at SL were the weekly meetings with Prof. Nipun. His guidance extended beyond theoretical solutions to the nitty-gritty of implementation. His mentorship played a crucial role in my development, not just academically but also in how I approach problems in my current corporate research role at Skan.
